### Sprint 1: Tools and Software Development Processes

| Week | Topic | Tangibles | Lab Notes |
|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| Week 0 | Tools & GH Pages Setup | [Hacks](https://github.com/AniCricKet/musical-guacamole/issues/1) | We began our journey in CSA by setting up a new Github Pages. For me, the biggest challenge was getting the theme to work, as it looked wonky and the theme wouldn't cover the whole page. I also had some problems where my index page was looping and I had random characters on my home page which I couldn't locate in my repository. But after a lot of trial and error, I was able to fix these problems and succesfully deploy on AWS.|
| Week 1 | Coding in Java | [Hacks](https://github.com/AniCricKet/musical-guacamole/issues/1) | In this week I tested if certain functions of the blog were working. First I tested to see if certain jupyter notebooks were working, and then I made a simple javascript tic-tac-toe game to test if frontend games were working. |
| Week 2 | Lazy Programming in Java | [Hacks]() | This week I worked on becoming more familiar with Programming in Javascript by tweaking the calculator, snake, and life game.  |
