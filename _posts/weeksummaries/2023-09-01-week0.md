We began our journey in CSA by setting up a new Github Pages. For me, the biggest challenge was getting the theme to work, as it looked wonky and the theme wouldn't cover the whole page. I also had some problems where my index page was looping and I had random characters on my home page which I couldn't locate in my repository. But after a lot of trial and error, I was able to fix these problems and successfully deploy on Github Pages.
